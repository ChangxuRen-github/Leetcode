/*
We can solve this question with sliding window technique: 
we maintain a sliding window [left, right), in which the window contains substrings that ensures every character in t is included in 
the window.

When do we move the right boundary? We greedly move the right boundary of the window to cover all characters of in target. 
The resulting window is not necessarily the shortest since some character may exceed the needed counts and can be removed 
from the left boundary of the window. 

When do we move the left boundary? As we find the first valid window, we move the left boundary to shrink the window size.
As long as the window contains all characters in t, we keep moving the left boundary until the window is not valid.
note: as we move the left boundary, we update the solution.

How do we know if window contains all characters in t?
we can use a map, we count all occurrence of the characters in t and save them in a map. As we expand the window, everytime we add a 
character to the window, we check if a character's freq in the window is equal to the character's freq in t. 
if the freq is equal we know one character is matched. Similary, as we move the left boundary of the window, if the character's 
freq is equal to the character's freq in t before we remove, we know the matched count is less one.
