[1683. Invalid Tweets](https://leetcode.com/problems/invalid-tweets/)

For a SQL table, the best function to use to count the number of characters used in a string is CHAR_LENGTH(str),
which returns the length of the string str.

The other common function, LENGTH(str), also works for this question since the column content contains only English characters
and no special characters. Otherwise, LENGTH() might return a different result because this function returns the length of 
the string str in bytes and certain characters contain more than 1 byte.

Using character 'Â¥' as an example: CHAR_LENGTH() returns 1 as the result, while LENGTH() return 2 because this string contains 2 bytes.
