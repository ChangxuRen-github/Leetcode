[584. Find Customer Referee](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-customer-referee/)

MySQL uses three-valued logic -- TRUE, FALSE, and UNKOWN. 
Anything compared to NULL evaluates to the third value: UNKNOWN. 
That "anything" includes NULL itself! By this reseason, MYSQL provides the `IS NULL` and `IS NOT NULL` operators to specifically check for `NULL`.
