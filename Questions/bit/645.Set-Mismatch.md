/*
Recall the question, we need to find a missing value from a sequnce from 1 to n. 
We use the property of xor bit operation. i.e., num ^ num = 0
Because any number xor itself is equal to 0. We can iterate through the whole sequnce and
do xor operation with num[i] and index i. For each nonmissing value, the value will xor itself, 
therefore "cancel out". Whereas, for the only missing value, it is being oxr only one time. 
Then, whatever we left is the missing value. 

For this question, we have one missing value and one duplicated value. If we follow the same 
method, then we know the resulting value will be the xor of the duplicated value and the missing value. 
Because for the duplicated value it is being xored three times and for the missing value it is being xored 
one time. 

Say, the duplicated value is dVal and missing value is mVal.
res = dVal ^ mVal
what implications can we learn from res?
For all the 1 bits from res, we know bits are different in dVal and mVal.
For all the 0 bits from res, we know bits are same in dVal and mVal.

For example: dVal: 0100 1010
             mVal: 1011 1001
             res:  1111 0011
                           |
                    rightmostBit
We can classify all numbers in range from 1 to n into two sets. Set1 contains all numbers that has rightmostBit
to be 1. Set2 contains all nubmers that has rightmostBit to be 0. And we know one set should have the duplicate value.
And the other sest should have the missing value. 

How to get the rightmost bit? 
Another bit trick... we know if we subtract 1 from the num, then all the bits to left to the rightmost bit 
will stay the same and the rightmost bit will turn into 0. Some zero bits may change to 1 right to the rightmost bit
but we do not care. 

if we consider num - 1's binary representation in three regions. To the left to the rightmost bit should stay the same. 
The rightmost bit will change to 0. Some bit to the right to the rightmost bit will change to 1.

If we flip bits of num - 1, we have a value that has rightmost bit to be 1. All bit that was 1 same as num will be zero.
Now, if we do & operation between num and ~(num-1). we get the rightmost bit.
