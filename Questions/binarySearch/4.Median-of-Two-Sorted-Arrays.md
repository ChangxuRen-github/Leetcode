What is median? 
In a sorted number sequence, median is the item that sits in the middle. 
If there are even number of items, the median is array[mid = length / 2].
If there are odd number of items, the median is the average of array[mid] and array[mid + 1]

If we have two sorted arrays, we can first sort them into a single array then apply the above logic. 


Let's inspce the following two sequences: 
x are the numbers smaller than the median and Y are the nubmers greater than the median


Goal is the find kth number from two sorted sequences.

Looking for the first k/2 number from each sequence:

seq1:
x x x x x x *1 x x x x K Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y   <- lenth1
            |

seq2: 
x x x x x x *2 x Y Y Y Y   <- length2
            |

If the k/2 of the first seq is greater than the k/2 of the second seq -> we can eliminate all numbers from [0:k/2] from seq2
If the k/2 of the second seq is greater than the k/2 of the first seq -> we can eliminate all numbers from  [0:k/2] from seq1

Then, we update the new k' = k - k / 2, and the problem remains the same. <- can solve the same question using recursion. 


Base cases:  
(1) what if k/2 is greater than either length1 or length2? (k/2 will never greater than both length1 and length2)
    we just eliminate k/2 of numbers from the one that does not exceed the length of the array
    
(2) when should we stop? 
    when k is 1, we can just compare the two numbers from seq1 and seq2 and return the min one.
