[276. Paint Fence](https://leetcode.com/problems/paint-fence/)

```Java
/*
Constraint: 
At most two consecutive colors: 
    case 1: one consecutive color
    case 2: two consecutive color
    
dp[n][k]: 
    case 1: dp[0][color_i] saves the number of ways to paint house that ends with one consecutive color_i
    case 2: dp[1][color_i] saves the number of ways to paint house that ends with two consecutive color_i

recurrence relation: 
    dp[0][color_i] = sum(dp[0][color_j]) + sum(dp[1][color_j]) in which color_i != color j from last step
    dp[1][color_i] = sum(dp[0][color_i]) in which color_i from last step

time complexity: o(n*k)
*/

class Solution {
    public int numWays(int n, int k) {
        int[][] last = new int[2][k];
        Arrays.fill(last[0], 1);
        int oneSum = k;
        int twoSum = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            int[][] cur = new int[2][k];
            int curOneSum = 0;
            int curTwoSum = 0;
            for (int color = 0; color < k; color++) {
                cur[0][color] = oneSum - last[0][color] + twoSum - last[1][color]; 
                cur[1][color] = last[0][color];
                curOneSum += cur[0][color];
                curTwoSum += cur[1][color];

            oneSum = curOneSum;
            twoSum = curTwoSum;
            last = cur;

Improvement? 
Assume we know the answer for totalWays(i-1) and totalWays(i-1), we want to calcualte totalWays(i)
There are two possible cases for position i: 
case 1: it is painted with a color that occurs only one time
        totalWays(i-1) * (k-1) <-- try all colors except the one painted on the last post

case 2: it is painted with a color that occurs two time
        can we still use totalWays(i-1)? 
        it contains one consecutive and two consecutive, we only want the number of one consecutive and paint the exact color as the 
        last one. But there is no way to distinguish one and two consecutive. 
        Consider totalWays(i-2): 
        Do we still care how many consecutive colors that ends at i-2? 
        No, whatever that color is. We just paint two consecutive posts at i-1, and i with the color that is different 
        from the color at i-2. 
        totalWays(i-2) * (k-1)
        
        
time complexity: o(n)        
Summary, the trick is we consider at the last step, we paint either one post or two posts together. 
Consider do the question proposed actions one time or two times at the last step.

        for (int i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
            int cur = (k-1) * (oneBack + twoBack);
            twoBack = oneBack;
            oneBack = cur;
