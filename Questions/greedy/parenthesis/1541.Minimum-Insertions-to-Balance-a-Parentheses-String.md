[1541. Minimum Insertions to Balance a Parentheses String](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-insertions-to-balance-a-parentheses-string/)

```Java
class Solution {
    public int minInsertions(String s) {
        int ans = 0;
        int rightRequired = 0;
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            if (c == '(') {
                if (rightRequired % 2 != 0) {
                    ans++;
                    rightRequired--;
                }
                rightRequired += 2;
            } else {
                rightRequired--;
                if (rightRequired < 0) {
                    ans++;
                    rightRequired = 1;
                }
            }
        }
        return ans + rightRequired;
    }
}

/*
"(()))')'()')'()')''('))"

For each char in s, there only two chars we can met.
case 1: char == '('
        case1.1: if there are fully unmatched '(' ---> no problem, there are chances they can be matched later
        case1.2: if there are halfly unmatched '(' ----> ans + 1, there are no way to match them later, since ()())) is not valid
        case1.3: if there are unmatched ')' ---> there are no ways that they can be matched later
                 case1.2.1: if there exists one unmatched ---> ans++, rightRequired += 2;
                 case1.2.2: if there are two unmatched     ---> ans += unmatched / 2
        
case 2: char == ')'
        case2.1: if there are fully unmatched '(' ----> no problem, they might be matched later
        case2.2: if there are halfly unmatched '(' ----> no problem, they might be matched later
        case2.2: if there are unmatched ')' ----> there are no ways that they can be matched
                case2.2.1: if there is only one unmatched ---> ans + 1, rightRequired + 2
                case2.2.2: if there are two unmatched     ---> ans + 1

How do we represent matched ( and )? 
Use a variable to save required ). If we see a (, we increase variable by 2. 
                                   If we see a ), we decrease variable by 1.

If variable >= 0 ----> there are unmatched (
If variable < 0 -----> there are unmatched )
