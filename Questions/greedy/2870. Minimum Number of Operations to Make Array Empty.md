[2870. Minimum Number of Operations to Make Array Empty](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-operations-to-make-array-empty/)

(1) Count the frequency of each num in nums.  
(2) Calculate the frequency mod 3 for each num:  
    The remainder could only be one of the three values: 0, 1, and 2  
    If the remainder is 0 --> we can remove all occurrence of the num by removing three nums at a time  
    If the remainder is 1 --> we can remove all occurrence of the num by removing 4 nums first, then the remaining three at a time  
    If the remainder is 2 --> we can remove all occurrence of the num by removing 2 nums first, then the remaining three at a time  
      

```Java
class Solution {
    public int minOperations(int[] nums) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> val2Freq = new HashMap<>();
        for (int num : nums) val2Freq.merge(num, 1, Integer::sum); 
        int ret = 0;
        for (int freq : val2Freq.values()) {
            if (freq == 1) return -1; 
            ret += (freq / 3 + (freq % 3 > 0 ? 1 : 0));
        }
        return ret;
    }
}
```
