[1167. Minimum Cost to Connect Sticks](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-to-connect-sticks/)

```Java
class Solution {
    public int connectSticks(int[] sticks) { 
        PriorityQueue<Integer> pq = new PriorityQueue<>((num1, num2) -> Integer.compare(num1, num2));
        for (int s : sticks) pq.offer(s);
        int cost = 0;
        while  (pq.size() > 1) {
            int smallest = pq.poll();
            int secondSmallest = pq.poll();
            cost += (smallest + secondSmallest);
            pq.offer(smallest + secondSmallest);
        }
        return cost;
    }
}
/*
Say I have three sticks, A, B, C and the length has the following relation A > B > C.
I have B in my hand, should I connect with A or C in the first step? 

if we connecct B and C first and A and (B+C)
total cost = (B + C) first step 
             (B + C) + A

if we connect B and A first and C and (B+A)
total cost = (B + A) first step 
             (B + A) + C


Because we know A > C. The first way gives lower cost.
So the greedy idea would be connecting shorter sticks early. 


Then, should we iteratively add one at a time or combine the neighbor first?
curStick  A and B

should we do ((curStick + A) + B) ----> cost1 = curStick + A + curStcik + B
or (curStick + (A + B))           ----> cost2 = A + B + curStick + A + B

Is cost1 smaller than cost2?
cost2 - cost1 = A + B - curStick
in what situations will cost2 greater than cost1?
if A + B is greater than curStick ----> cost2 > cost1 ----> we should connect curStick and A first
if A + B is smaller than curStick ----> cost2 < cost1 ----> we should connect A and B first

In summary, we should always connect the smallest two from the pile. 
A heap/priority queue can help us to get the smallest two from the pile.
