Bit Operations
===============
AND operation:
--------------
Then AND operation x & y produces a number that has one bits in positions
where both x and y have one bits. Using the AND operation, we can check
if a number x is even because x & 1 = 0 if x is even, and x & 1 = 1 if x 
is odd. *More generally, x is divisible by 2^(k) exactly when x & (2^(k) - 1) = 0.*   
> bit & 0 = 0 
> bit & 1 = bit
